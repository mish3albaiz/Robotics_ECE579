# we were unable to compile RosAria with catkin_make unless we increased the RAM
# by adding a ton of swap memory. these commdands will create a 2gig file called
# /swapmem and tell the system to treat it as extra RAM. 
# after rebooting, the file will still exist but it won't be treated as extra RAM 
# any more. but you shouldn't need all that swap mem space except for when 
# compiling the ROS packages, which is a one-time thing.

# check current memory size/state
free -h
# create a 2gig file called /swapfile, runs in the background
# wait a few seconds, use "ls -lh /swapfile" to confirm it finished
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
# change permissions
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
# identify this as a swap file
sudo mkswap /swapfile
# enable the use of swap memory
sudo swapon /swapfile
# check the state of swap memory usage
sudo swapon -s
# confirm that you now have loads of swap memory
free -h

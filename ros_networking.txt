# to make ROS networking work, there's a few things you need to do.
# first, only one "master" machine should be running roscore.
# this OS image is currently set up to launch roscore whenever it boots, that feature
# should be disabled on all machine but one.
# to kill already-running roscore process:
sudo killall roscore rosmaster
# to stop it from launching on bootup:
sudo systemctl disable roscore.service
# to re-enable launching on bootup:
sudo systemctl enable roscore.service

# you also need to set up the ROS_HOSTNAME/ROS_IP and ROS_MASTER_URI 
# variables. these are set in /home/ubuntu/ros_networking.bash
# ROS_HOSTNAME is the preferred method but we couldn't get the DHCP name
# resolution to work, might be an issue with the settings in this OS or might be an
# issue with configuring the network, who knows.
# the system need to have the correct IP address for itself, and for its master. to learn
# the address of a machine, use:
ifconfig
# and look for the "inet addr" field in the paragraph labeled "wlan0"

# to interact with the pioneer2 bot over serial using RosAria,
# you need to first ensure that the "radio" switch is OFF.
# use this command to check if usb0 is connected:
dmesg | grep ttyUSB0
# each time you connect/disconnect the cable it should get a 
# new timestamp in this log

# we didn't explore this too much tbh.

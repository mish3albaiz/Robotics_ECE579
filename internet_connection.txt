# this system came with a tool called "pifi" that runs on bootup and automatically
# does some wifi stuff. you can give it a network name/password and it will usually
# auto connect on bootup. if it doesn't have a network name/password to connect
# to, it will boot as a wifi access point that lets other machines connect to it directly.
# google "pifi" for more info.

# currently it is set up to connect to "PSU Guest" automatically. but this network
# requires that your time be approximately right (see timesync.txt) and then requires
# you to accept the login page every 24 hours. open firefox and use the "Web
# Authentication redirect" bookmark to get to the right page.

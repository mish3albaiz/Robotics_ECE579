# the system should be set up to automatically call NTP and will update the time/date
# 10-20 minutes after successfully connecting to the internet.

# however it cannot connect to the PSU Guest internet if the time is off by too much,
# like years, and the date resets to 2016 every time the PI completely loses power.
# it can't connect to the internet cuz the time is wrong, and it cant fix the time cuz
# it can't connect to the internet. this might behave better on a different network
# that doesn't have so much protections, i can't say for certain.

# set the date to the correct day or else PSU Guest won't even let you in. use this to 
# set correct day (plus or minus a few months), then connect to internet, then it 
# will eventually sync to the correct time.
sudo date +%Y%m%d -s "20200307"

# these commdands should force the time to synchronize right away, only works 
# if it has a working internet of course.
sudo systemctl stop ntp
sudo ntpd -q -g
sudo systemctl start ntp

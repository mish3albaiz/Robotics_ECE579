# catkin is the build system used to manage ROS packages.
# the catkin workspace is ~/catkin_ws, there is a link on the desktop to ~/catkin_ws/src
# where all the packages should be stored. google for how to handle/make ROS 
# catkin packages.

# after copying files from a Windows machine, you will probably need
# to run "dos2unix" on those files. this definitely needs run on any
# python scripts you want to use as part of a ROS package. 

# for toplevel or entrypoint scripts, you also need to ensure they are 
# executable with "chmod +x asdfasdf" and also have "#!/usr/bin/env python" 
# as their first line, or else ROS won't like them. this is not needed
# for files that are simply imported. you also need to do this to run
# a python script by simply double-clicking it.

# to build a catkin package:
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin_create_pkg inmoov rospy std_msgs sensor_msgs
cd ..
catkin_make
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash


# some handy ros commands: google for more info
